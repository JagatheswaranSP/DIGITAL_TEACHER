    <section><p><h2>Java LinkedList</h2>
        In the previous chapter, you learned about the ArrayList class. The LinkedList class is almost identical to the ArrayList:
        <br>
        Example<pre>
        // Import the LinkedList class
        import java.util.LinkedList;
        
        public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
            LinkedList<String> cars = new LinkedList<String>();
            cars.add("Volvo");
            cars.add("BMW");
            cars.add("Ford");
            cars.add("Mazda");
            System.out.println(cars);
          }
        }
        </pre>
        <h2>ArrayList vs. LinkedList</h2>
        The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList.
        
        The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface. This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.
        
        However, while the ArrayList class and the LinkedList class can be used in the same way, they are built very differently.
        
        <h4>How the ArrayList works</h4>
        The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.
        
        <h4>How the LinkedList works</h4>
        The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.
        
        <h4>When To Use</h4>
        Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.
        
        <h2>LinkedList Methods</h2>
        For many cases, the ArrayList is more efficient as it is common to need access to random items in the list, but the LinkedList provides several methods to do certain operations more efficiently:
        <br>
        addFirst()	Adds an item to the beginning of the list.<br>
        addLast()	Add an item to the end of the list	<br>
        removeFirst()	Remove an item from the beginning of the list.	<br>
        removeLast()	Remove an item from the end of the list	<br>
        getFirst()	Get the item at the beginning of the list	<br>
        getLast()	Get the item at the end of the list</p></section><footer>
