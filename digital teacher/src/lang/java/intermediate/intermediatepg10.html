    <header>Java Polymorphism</header>
    <section><p><h2>Java Polymorphism</h2>
        Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
        
        Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
        
        For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):
        <br>
        Example<pre>
        class Animal {
          public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
          }
        }
        
        class Pig extends Animal {
          public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
          }
        }
        
        class Dog extends Animal {
          public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
          }
        }</pre>
        Remember from the Inheritance chapter that we use the extends keyword to inherit from a class.
        
        Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and call the animalSound() method on both of them:
        <br>
        Example<pre>
        class Animal {
          public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
          }
        }
        
        class Pig extends Animal {
          public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
          }
        }
        
        class Dog extends Animal {
          public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
          }
        }
        
        class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
            Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object
            Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
            Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object
            myAnimal.animalSound();
            myPig.animalSound();
            myDog.animalSound();
          }
        }</pre>
        Why And When To Use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?<br>
        - It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.</p></section><footer>
