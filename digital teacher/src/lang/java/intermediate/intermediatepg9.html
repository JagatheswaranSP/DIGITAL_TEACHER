    <section><p><h2>Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)</h2>
        In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
        
        subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
        superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
        To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
        <br>
        In the example below, the Car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (superclass):
        <br>
        Example<pre>
        class Vehicle {
          protected String brand = "Ford";        // Vehicle attribute
          public void honk() {                    // Vehicle method
            System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");
          }
        }
        
        class Car extends Vehicle {
          private String modelName = "Mustang";    // Car attribute
          public static void main(String[] args) {
        
            // Create a myCar object
            Car myCar = new Car();
        
            // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
            myCar.honk();
        
            // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
            System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
          }
        }
        </pre>  
        
        Did you notice the protected modifier in Vehicle?
        <br>
        We set the brand attribute in Vehicle to a protected access modifier. 
        If it was set to private, the Car class would not be able to access it.
        <br>
        Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?<br>
        - It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
        <br>
        Tip: Also take a look at the next chapter, Polymorphism, which uses inherited methods to perform different tasks.
        <br>
        <h2>The final Keyword</h2>
        If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the final keyword:
        
        If you try to access a final class, Java will generate an error:
        
        final class Vehicle {
          ...
        }
        
        class Car extends Vehicle {
          ...
        }
        The output will be something like this:
        <pre>
        Main.java:9: error: cannot inherit from final Vehicle
        class Main extends Vehicle {
                          ^
        1 error)</pre></p></section><footer>
