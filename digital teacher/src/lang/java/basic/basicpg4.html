        <h3>Java Comments</h3>
        Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. 
        It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

        <h3>Single-line Comments</h3>
        Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
        Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).
        This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code
    <pre>
// This is a comment
System.out.println("Hello World");
    </pre>
        <h3>Java Multi-line Comments</h3>
        Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
        Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.
        This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code
    
    <pre>
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
System.out.println("Hello World");
    </pre>
        Single or multi-line comments?
        It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.
