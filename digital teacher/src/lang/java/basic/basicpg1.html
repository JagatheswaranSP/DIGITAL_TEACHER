                JAVA INTRODUCTION
            </h3>
                JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. 
                It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language.  
                Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java.  
                It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.
                   
            <h3>
                Main Features of JAVA
            </h3>
                Java is a platform independent language, Compiler(javac) converts source code (.java file) to the byte code(.class file). 
                As mentioned above, JVM executes the bytecode produced by compiler. 
                This byte code can run on any platform such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS etc. 
                Which means a program that is compiled on windows can run on Linux and vice-versa. 
                Each operating system has different JVM, 
                however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems.
                That is why we call java as platform independent language.
                java code that is written on one machine can run on another machine. 
                The platform independent byte code can be carried to any platform for execution that makes java code portable.
            
            <h3>
                 Why Java
            </h3>
                Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
                It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
                It is easy to learn and simple to use
                It is open-source and free
                It is secure, fast and powerful
                It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
                Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
                As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
