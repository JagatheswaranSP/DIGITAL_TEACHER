        <h3>Main.java</h3>

public class Main {

        Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. 
            In our example, we named the class Main. 
            A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

            The Main Method
        </h3>
        <pre>
            public static void main(String[] args)
        </pre>
        Any code inside the main() method will be executed. 
            Don't worry about the keywords before and after main. 
            You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.
            For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.
        <h3>
            System.out.println()
        </h3>
        <pre>
            public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
        </pre>
        The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
            System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". 
            The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
            Don't worry too much about System, out and println(). Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.
            You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
