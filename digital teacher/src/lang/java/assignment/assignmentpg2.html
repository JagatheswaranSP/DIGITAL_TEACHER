    <section><h2>Java Program to Find Largest of Three Numbers</h2><p>we will learn how to create a Java program to find the largest of three numbers. 
        Along with this, we will also learn to find the largest of three numbers in Java using the ternary operator.
        <h3>Using Ternary Operator</h3>
        Before moving to the program, let's understand the ternary operator.

        It is a part of the Java conditional statement. It contains three operands. It evaluates a Boolean expression and assigned a value based on the result. We can use it in place of the if-else statement. The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

        <pre>variable_name = (expression) ? value if true:value if false</pre> 
        If the above expression returns true the value before the colon is assigned to the variable variable_name, else the value after the colon is assigned to the variable.
        <h3>Using if-else..if</h3>

        <h3>Using nested if</h3>
        <p>Refer this page <a href="../basic/basicpg11.html" target="_blank">nested if</a>
