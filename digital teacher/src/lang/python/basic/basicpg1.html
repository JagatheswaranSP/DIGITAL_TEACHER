                PYTHON INTRODUCTION
            </h3>
            Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language.
            It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python 
            Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, 
            and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
            Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate 
            systems more efficiently.

            <h3>
                Main features of PYTHON
            </h3>
            Python provides many useful features which make it popular and valuable from 
            the other programming languages. It supports object-oriented programming, 
            procedural programming approaches and provides dynamic memory allocation.
            Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages.
            Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. 
            A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print("Hello World"). 
            Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time.
            Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh,etc.
            Python is freely available for everyone.Python supports object-oriented language and concepts 
            of classes and objects come into existence.Graphical User Interface is used for the developing 
            Desktop application.It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc.
            The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code.
            In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable.

            <h3>
                Why Python
            </h3>
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
            Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
            Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with 
            fewer lines than some other programming languages.Python runs on an 
            interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. 
            This means that prototyping can be very quick.Python can be treated in a 
            procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way
