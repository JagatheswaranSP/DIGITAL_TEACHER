                Dictionary
            </h3>
            Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
            A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
            Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
            <pre>
                Example
                Create and print a dictionary:
                thisdict = {
                    "brand": "Ford",
                    "model": "Mustang",
                    "year": 1964
                  }
                print(thisdict)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Dictionary Items
            </h3>
            Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
            Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
            <pre>
                Example
                Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:
                thisdict = {
                    "brand": "Ford",
                    "model": "Mustang",
                    "year": 1964
                  }
                 print(thisdict["brand"])
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Ordered or Unordered?
            </h3>
            When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
            Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.
            <h3>
                Changeable
            </h3>
            Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
            <h3>
                Duplicates Not Allowed
            </h3>
            Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
            <pre>
                Example
                Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:
                thisdict = {
                    "brand": "Ford",
                    "model": "Mustang",
                    "year": 1964,
                    "year": 2020
                }
                print(thisdict)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Dictionary Length
            </h3>
            To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
            <pre>
                Example
                Print the number of items in the dictionary:
                print(len(thisdict))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Dictionary Items - Data Types
            </h3>
            The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:
            <pre>
                Example
                String, int, boolean, and list data types:
                thisdict = {
                    "brand": "Ford",
                    "electric": False,
                    "year": 1964,
                    "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
                }
            </pre>
            <h3>
                type()
            </h3>
            From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict':
            <pre>
                Example
                Print the data type of a dictionary:
                thisdict = {
                    "brand": "Ford",
                    "model": "Mustang",
                    "year": 1964
                }
                print(type(thisdict))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Python Collections (Arrays)
            </h3>
            There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

            *List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
            *Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
            *Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
            *Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
