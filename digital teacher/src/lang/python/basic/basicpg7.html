                <h3>
                    Strings
                </h3>
                Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
               'hello' is the same as "hello".
                You can display a string literal with the print() function:
                <pre>
                    Example
                    print("Hello")
                    print('Hello')
                </pre>
                <h3>
                    Assign String to a Variable
                </h3>    
                Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
                <pre>
                    Example
                    a = "Hello"
                    print(a)
                </pre>
                <h3>
                    Multiline Strings
                </h3>
                You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
                <pre>Example
                    You can use three double quotes:
                    
                    a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
                    consectetur adipiscing elit,
                    sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
                    ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
                    print(a)
                </pre>
                Or three single quotes:
                <pre>
                    Example
                    a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
                    consectetur adipiscing elit,
                    sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
                    ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
                    print(a)
                </pre>
                <h3>
                    Strings are Arrays
                </h3>
                Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
                However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
                Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
                <pre>
                    Example
                    Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):
                    a = "Hello, World!"
                    print(a[1])
                </pre>
                <h3>
                    Looping Through a String
                </h3>
                Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.
                <pre>
                    Example
                    Loop through the letters in the word "banana":
                    for x in "banana":
                    print(x)
                </pre>
                <h3>
                    String Length
                </h3>
                To get the length of a string, use the len() function.
                <pre>
                    Example
                    The len() function returns the length of a string:
                    a = "Hello, World!"
                    print(len(a))
                </pre>
                <h3>
                    Check String
                </h3>
                To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
                <pre>
                    Example
                    Check if "free" is present in the following text:
                    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
                    print("free" in txt)
                </pre>
                Use it in an if statement:
                <pre>
                    Example
                    Print only if "free" is present:

                    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
                    if "free" in txt:
                    print("Yes, 'free' is present.")
                </pre>
                <h3>
                    Check if NOT
                </h3>
                To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
                <pre>Example
                    Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:
                    
                    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
                    print("expensive" not in txt)
                </pre>
                Use it in an if statement:
                <pre>
                    Example
                    print only if "expensive" is NOT present:

                    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
                    if "expensive" not in txt:
                    print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")
                </pre>
                </p>
