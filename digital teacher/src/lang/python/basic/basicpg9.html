                Python Tuples
            </h3>

                mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

            <h3>
                Tuple
            </h3>
            Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
            A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
            Tuples are written with round brackets.
            <pre>
                Example
                Create a Tuple:

                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                print(thistuple)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Tuple Items
            </h3>
            Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
            Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
            <h3>
                Ordered
            </h3>
            When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
            <h3>
                Unchangeable
            </h3>
            Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
            <h3>
                Allow Duplicates
            </h3>
            Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:
            <pre>
                Example
                Tuples allow duplicate values:

                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
                print(thistuple)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Tuple Length
            </h3>
            To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:
            <pre>
                Example
                Print the number of items in the tuple:

                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                print(len(thistuple))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Create Tuple With One Item
            </h3>
            To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
            <pre>
                Example
                One item tuple, remember the comma:

                thistuple = ("apple",)
                print(type(thistuple))

                #NOT a tuple
                thistuple = ("apple")
                print(type(thistuple))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Tuple Items - Data Types
            </h3>
            Tuple items can be of any data type:
            <pre>
                Example
                String, int and boolean data types:

                tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
                tuple3 = (True, False, False)
            </pre>
            A tuple can contain different data types:
            <pre>
                Example
                A tuple with strings, integers and boolean values:

                tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")
            </pre>
            <h3>
                type()
            </h3>
            From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple':
            <pre>
                Example
                What is the data type of a tuple?

                mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                print(type(mytuple))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                The tuple() Constructor
            </h3>
            It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.
            <pre>
                Example
                Using the tuple() method to make a tuple:

                thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
                print(thistuple)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Python Collections (Arrays)
            </h3>
            There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

            *List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
            *Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
            *Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
            *Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
