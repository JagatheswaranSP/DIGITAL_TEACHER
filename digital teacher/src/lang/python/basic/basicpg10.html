            <h3>
                Python Sets
            </h3>
            <pre>
                myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Set
            </h3>
            Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
            A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
            Sets are written with curly brackets.
            <pre>
                Example
                Create a Set:
                thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
                print(thisset)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Set Items
            </h3>
            Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
            <h3>
                Unordered
            </h3>
            Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
            Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
            <h3>
                Unchangeable
            </h3>
            Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
            Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.
            <h3>
                Duplicates Not Allowed
            </h3>
            Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
            <pre>
                Example
                Duplicate values will be ignored:
                thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
                print(thisset)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Get the Length of a Set
            </h3>
            To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.
            <pre>
                Example
                Get the number of items in a set:
                thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
                print(len(thisset))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Set Items - Data Types
            </h3>
            Set items can be of any data type:
            <pre>
                Example
                String, int and boolean data types:
                set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
                set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
                set3 = {True, False, False}
            </pre>
            A set can contain different data types:
            <pre>
                Example
                A set with strings, integers and boolean values:
                set1 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}
            </pre>
            <h3>
                type()
            </h3>
            From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set':
            <pre>
                Example
                What is  the data type of a set?
                myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
                print(type(myset))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                The set() Constructor
            </h3>
            It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.
            <pre>
                Example
                Using the set() constructor to make a set:
                thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
                print(thisset)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Python Collections (Arrays)
            </h3>
            There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

            List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
            Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
            Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
            Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
