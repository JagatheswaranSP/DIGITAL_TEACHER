                Python Lists
            </h3>
            <pre>
                mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            </pre>
            <h3>
                List
            </h3>
            Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
            Lists are created using square brackets:
            <pre>
                Example
                Create a List:

                thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                print(thislist)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                List Items
            </h3>
            List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
            List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
            <h3>
                Ordered
            </h3>
            When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
            If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
            <h3>
                Changeable
            </h3>
            The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
            <h3>
                Allow Duplicates
            </h3>
            Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
            <pre>
                Example
                Lists allow duplicate values:

                thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
                print(thislist) 
            </pre>
            <h3>
                List Length
            </h3>
            To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
            <pre>
                Example
                Print the number of items in the list:

                thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                print(len(thislist))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                List Items - Data Types
            </h3>
            List items can be of any data type:
            <pre>
                Example
                String, int and boolean data types:

                list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
                list3 = [True, False, False]
            </pre>
            A list can contain different data types:
            <pre>
                Example
                A list with strings, integers and boolean values:

                list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
            </pre>
            <h3>
                type()
            </h3>
            From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
            <pre>
                Example
                What is the data type of a list?

                mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                print(type(mylist))
            </pre>
            <h3>
                The list() Constructor
            </h3>
            It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.
            <pre>
                Example
                Using the list() constructor to make a List:

                thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
                print(thislist)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Python Collections (Arrays)   
            </h3>
            There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

            *List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
            *Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
            *Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
            *Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
