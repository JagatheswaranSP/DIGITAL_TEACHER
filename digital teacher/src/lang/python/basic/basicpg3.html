            <h3>
                Python Comments
            </h3>
            Comments can be used to explain Python code.
            Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
            Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
            <h3>
                Creating a Comment 
            </h3>
                Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
            <pre>
                Example
                  #This is a comment
                  print("Hello, World!")
            </pre> 
                Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
            <pre>
                Example
                  print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
            </pre>
                 A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
            <pre>
                Example
                  #print("Hello, World!")
                  print("Cheers, Mate!")
            </pre>
            <h3>
                Multi Line Comments
            </h3>
                Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
                To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
            <pre>
                Example
                  #This is a comment
                  #written in
                  #more than just one line
                  print("Hello, World!") 
            </pre>
                 Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
                 Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
            <pre>
                Example
                  """
                  This is a comment
                  written in
                  more than just one line
                  """
                  print("Hello, World!")
            </pre>
                 As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
