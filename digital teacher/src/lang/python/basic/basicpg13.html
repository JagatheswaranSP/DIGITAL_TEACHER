        PYTHON WHILE LOOPS

            <h3>
                Python Loops
            </h3>
            Python has two primitive loop commands:
            *while loops ,
            *for loops
            <h3>
                The while Loop
            </h3>
            With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
            <pre>
                Example
                Print i as long as i is less than 6:
                i = 1
                while i < 6:
                print(i)
                i += 1
            </pre>
            The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
            <h3>
                The break Statement
            </h3>
            With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
            <pre>
                Example
                Exit the loop when i is 3:
                i = 1
                while i < 6:
                 print(i)
                if i == 3:
                  break
                i += 1
            </pre>
            <h3>
                The continue Statement
            </h3>
            With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
            <pre>
                Example
                Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
                i = 0
                while i < 6:
                  i += 1
                if i == 3:
                   continue
                print(i)
            </pre>
            <h3>
                The else Statement
            </h3>
            With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
            <pre>
                Example
                Print a message once the condition is false:
                i = 1
                while i < 6:
                print(i)
                 i += 1
                else:
                print("i is no longer less than 6")
            </pre>
        </p>
