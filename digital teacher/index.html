        <h2>Why DIGITAL LEARNING</h2>
            <h3>Full-Time Access To Materials</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most important benefits of using digital learning is that materials are always available to studentsâ€”24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
            This gives students complete flexibility over when and where they study, enabling them to take control over the best times to study for themselves
        </p>
        <h3>Facilitates Collaboration</h3>
        <p>It Enabling students and teachers to use shared documents, or simply by helping to prepare students for the world of work.</p>
        <h3>More Resources</h3>
        <p>Resources such as recorded lectures or additional reading can be easily shared, giving students the opportunity to maximize their learning, and to go over subjects that they find more challenging as well as get extra information relating to subjects that they wish to understand better.</p>
        <h3>Better Engagement</h3>
        <p>Digital analysis can help educational institutions to get a better understanding of the engagement of their students with specific parts of their courses, or the institution as a whole. This means that educational institutions can quickly pick up on it if a student is becoming disengaged, struggling with the course, or is ill, and have the tools to remedy the situation more efficiently.</p>
        <h3> Personalized Learning</h3>
        <p>Digital learning can help enable personalized learning, in that everybody has specific techniques and learning methods that suit them. Digital learning can help students and teachers to get a better understanding of the most effective teaching methods for them, helping the delivery of teaching and learning to be more effective.</p>
        <h3>Preparation for Work</h3>
        <p>The incorporation of digital learning and teaching, as well as engagement methods, can be a great way to prepare students for working life, both in the technology that they are using and also in the ability to learn how to use new digital tools.</p>
        <h3>Boosts Accountability</h3>
        <p>One of the greatest benefits of digital learning is that it can help to enhance student accountability. By giving students more control over their own education, what they are studying, and how they are studying it, they will also have more accountability over their progress. Although this should not mean that the educational institution leaves the responsibility solely with the student, it does mean that the student can have a degree of ownership over their education.</p>
        <h3>Student Progress Tracking</h3>
        <p>Technology gives educational institutions the ability to track student progress closely. This can include everything from examination results to individual assessments and attendance records. This enables teachers to gain a good understanding of patterns and areas for teaching and learning improvement at any time.</p>

        <h2>How DIGITAL TEACHER works?</h2>
        <h3>Learning Method</h3>
        <p>
        Because Digital Teacher is still in its early stages, it only has a few subjects to study. As of now, it has a programming language that helps to learn the coding skills. 
        According to our research, most students skip the entire session. As a result, we devised a progressive learning strategy. 
        In this method, we slip learning into five parts:</p>
        <ul><li>Basic level</li>
            <li>Intermediate level</li>
            <li>Assignment level</li>
            <li>Project level</li> 
            <li>Examination level</li>
            <li>Result level</li></ul>
        <p>After learning from the first level, which was pre-unlocked, you need to complete the quiz activity in order to ascend to the next level.
        After got qualified in quiz you will have a random key to unlock the next level.</p>
        </p>
